        <h2>Saint Martin: My Favourite Place</h2>
        <p>
            Saint Martin's Island is a beautiful coral island in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, about 9 km south of the tip of the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula. Known for its breathtaking views, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant marine life, Saint Martin feels like a little slice of paradise.
        </p>
        <p>
            With coconut trees swaying in the breeze and the soothing sounds of waves, it's easy to see why this island is cherished by locals and tourists alike. The nights reveal an unpolluted starry sky, something rare and magical. Itâ€™s a place where nature and serenity come together perfectly.

        <h3>A Poem for Saint Martin</h3>
        <pre>
            "On sands so soft, where waves meet the shore,
            I find peace that I long for more.
            Sun <sup>above</sup> shines with warmth so true,
            While waves wash sands in colors of blue.
            Saint Martin, you hold my heart,
            In your embrace, I never want to part.
            Like a <sub>treasure</sub> deep in the sea,
            You are a paradise just for me."
